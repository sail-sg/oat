## Introduction
Oat ðŸŒ¾ is a simple yet efficient learning system for executing online LLM alignment algorithms. Its features include:

* **Highly efficient**: Oat implements a distributed *Actor-Learner-Oracle* architecture, with each component being optimized with state-of-the-art technologies:
  * `Actor` is built with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to accelerate the online response sampling.
  * `Learner` utilizes [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) ZeRO strategies for enhancing memory-efficiency.
  * `Oracle` is hosted by [Mosec](https://github.com/mosecorg/mosec) as a remote service that supports dynamic request batching, and data parallel & pipeline parallel computation.
* **Simplification**: Oat largely simplifies the experimental pipeline of LLM alignment. With the `Oracle` served online, we can flexibly query it for preference data collection as well as anytime model evaluation. All you need is to launch your experiment and wait for learning curves (e.g., win rate) to be reported to wandb. No tedious training, checkpointing, loading for evaluation, etc. Everything happens online!
* **Easy-to-use**: The modular design of oat allows researcher to simply inherit existing classes and make effortless modifications on any of the components to verify new algorithms.

## Installation :wrench:
Oat requires a python environment with `python==3.10`. Install via PyPI:
```console
pip install vllm==0.6.2 && pip install oat-llm
```
Or you could also install in "editable" mode for local development:
```console
git clone git@github.com:sail-sg/oat.git
cd oat
pip install vllm==0.6.2 && pip install -e .
```
